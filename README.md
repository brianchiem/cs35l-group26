## How to edit

### Github Desktop

Brian: I recommend installing Github Desktop.

### Get code

Clone repository. You can do this easily through Github Desktop.

`cd` into `wordle-clone` and install requirements (npm needs to be installed)

```shell
cd ./wordle-clone
npm install
```
ALSO INSTALL REACT ROUTER: `npm i -D react-router-dom`

### Temp: Front-end Dev Server

Verify you are in the project directory `wordle-clone`. Run:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This will give you a link to a locally hosted server you can access from your browser.
